# Semantic Segmentation Supervised Dataset
This data is from ***link** and showcases satellite images of Dubai. <br>
As the images are too large for our model to process they need to be broken into smaller patches before we are able to train our model. Please see the Semantic Segmentation notebook for the approach.
